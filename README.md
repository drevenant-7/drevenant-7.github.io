# drevenant-7.github.io

This repository contains the source for my personal website, published with GitHub Pages at:
https://drevenant-7.github.io

If you haven't added content yet, this README provides a simple starter guide for how to develop, preview, and publish the site.

---

## Contents / Purpose

- Host a personal website or portfolio using GitHub Pages.
- Keep the site source (HTML/CSS/JS or Jekyll site) in this repository.
- Automatically publish the site at `https://drevenant-7.github.io` when changes are pushed to the default branch.

---

## Quick start

Choose one of the two common approaches below depending on how you want to build the site:

A) Plain static site (no Jekyll)
1. Add an `index.html` at the repository root and any assets (CSS, JS, images).
2. Commit and push to the default branch (usually `main` or `master`).
3. GitHub Pages will serve the repository root as a static site.

B) Jekyll-based site
1. Install Ruby and Bundler (if you want to build locally):
   - macOS / Linux: use your package manager to install Ruby, then `gem install bundler jekyll`
   - Windows: use RubyInstaller and then `gem install bundler jekyll`
2. If a `Gemfile` exists, run:
   - `bundle install`
   - `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4000` to preview locally.
4. Commit and push to the default branch; GitHub Pages will build the Jekyll site automatically.

---

## Recommended repository structure

- index.html or index.md (root)
- assets/
  - css/
  - js/
  - images/
- _config.yml (for Jekyll)
- _posts/ (for Jekyll blog posts)

Adjust to match the static-site generator or theme you choose.

---

## Custom domain (optional)

To use a custom domain:
1. Create a `CNAME` file at the repository root containing your domain (e.g. `example.com`).
2. Configure your DNS to point to GitHub Pages:
   - For apex domains, use A records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs.
   - For subdomains, use a CNAME to `drevenant-7.github.io`.
3. Wait for DNS to propagate and verify under repository Settings → Pages.

---

## Themes and templates

- You can pick a Jekyll theme or use a static site template (e.g., HTML5 UP, Bootstrap templates).
- If you want a simple starter, I can add a minimalist template or set up a Jekyll theme for you.

---

## Deployment / GitHub Pages

- For a user/organization site, Pages serves the repository published at `https://<username>.github.io`.
- No extra configuration is required if you keep your site source at the repository root and push to the default branch.
- If you prefer a build step (e.g., a static site generator that outputs to `docs/`), configure the publishing source in the repo Settings → Pages.

---

## Contributing & workflow

- Edit content locally, preview, then push to the default branch.
- Use branches and pull requests if you want reviews before publishing.
- Consider enabling GitHub Actions for automated builds if you use a generator that requires a build step.

---

## Next steps I can help with

- Initialize a basic HTML/CSS starter site in this repo.
- Set up Jekyll with a theme and example posts/pages.
- Add a GitHub Action to build and deploy a site generated by another SSG (Hugo, Eleventy, etc.).
- Configure a custom domain and DNS instructions.
